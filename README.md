Raks Development Test API 

</h1>

## **:computer: About**
This project consists of a technical test for backend development with NodeJS.

A CRUD API was built to manage user data using MySQL database.

And finally, tests were implemented using Jest.

### How has been designed 
The project was divided into simple layers of database, models and controllers:

* The controller mediates the input and output of data, communicating with the User model.
* The model manages the behavior of the data and communicates with the database, making access to the data that must be collected, recorded or updated.
* The database was structured using ORM Sequelize migrations.

App, routes and server startup configuration files were also generated.

## ‚öôÔ∏è NodeJS API

The API has the basic features of creating, reading, updating and deleting.

* **POST: /user**: Create a new user 
```bash
Example: localhost:3000/user

Body:
{
  "name": "Natasha Romanoff",
  "dob": "2021-07-09",
  "address": "Avengers Mansion",
  "description": "Black Widow"
}

Return: 
{
    "message": "User created successfully",
    "user": {
        "id": 2,
        "name": "Natasha Romanoff",
        "dob": "2021-07-09",
        "address": "Avengers Mansion",
        "description": "Black Widow",

## :rocket: How to run the code

Before you begin, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine: 
* [Git](https://git-scm.com) 
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
* [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)
* In addition, it is good to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

Create and configure the **.env** file like this:
```bash
  PORT=3000

  DB_HOST=localhost
  DB_USERNAME=your_user_name
  DB_DATABASE=your_database_name
  DB_PASS=you_database_password
```
_Remember to configure according to your local MySQL settings._

On your terminal do the following:
```bash
  # Clone this repository
  $ git clone https://github.com/Nadine-Schneider/node-backend-test.git

  # Install the dependencies
  $ npm i
  
  # Create database
  $ npx sequelize db:create
  
  # Run the migrations
  $ npx sequelize db:migrate
  
  # Run seeders to create initial data
  $ npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all

  # Run the application in development mode
  $ npm run dev
  
  # You can also run the tests
  $ npm run test
```
Congratulations the server will run on the port set in PORT :tada:

You can try the API with Postman
